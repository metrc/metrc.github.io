## REDCap Branching Logic Parser

This Python library automatically parses the REDCap platform's branching logic strings. In REDCap, instruments 
contain fields (i.e. 'variables') which may be displayed conditionally using their branching logic parameter. 
This function is often used to conceal irrelevant questions in an instrument, or to direct (i.e. branch) the 
question-flow. Download through the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/metrc/redcap-branch-parser).
